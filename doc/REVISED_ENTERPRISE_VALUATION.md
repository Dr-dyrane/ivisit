## **Valuation Methodology**

### **Current Valuation: $1.5M - $3M**

**Value Drivers:**
-   **IP & Tech Asset**: Full-stack, enterprise-grade architecture (React, TypeScript, Supabase) ready for scale.
-   **Market Opportunity**: Addressing the $1.2B Nigerian private healthcare market with a clear path to the $400B global EMS market.
-   **Efficiency Gains**: Reducing coordination time between incident and hospitalization by an estimated 40-60%.
-   **Low-Cost Validation**: Leveraging Nigeria as a strategic test bed to refine the algorithm before global licensing.

### **Projected Valuation Trajectory**
-   **Phase 1 (Nigeria Launch, 0-18 months)**: $5M - $10M (Targeting 50k users, 100+ hospital partners).
-   **Phase 2 (Pan-African Expansion, 18-36 months)**: $20M - $50M.
-   **Phase 3 (Global Licensing/Exit, 3+ years)**: $100M+.

## **Competitive Landscape**

### **Market Position**
iVisit sits at the intersection of **Telehealth** and **Physical Logistics**, filling the gap left by platforms that only provide video consultations.

### **Differentiators**
-   **Inventory Visibility**: Real-time hospital bed availability (unique in the African market).
-   **Design-Led Engineering**: Apple-level UI/UX ensures low friction during high-stress emergencies.
-   **Asset-Light Model**: Does not own ambulances; coordinates existing private/public fleets.

## **Risk Mitigation & Execution**

### **Realistic Operational Targets**
-   **Response Time**: Target <10 minute dispatch; <20 minute on-site arrival (location dependent).
-   **Regulatory Compliance**: Phased integration with state health ministries and private insurance regulators.
-   **Infrastructure**: Offline-first PWA features to handle low-bandwidth environments in Nigeria.

---

## **Investment Highlights**

-   **Validated Pain Point**: Solving the critical delay in emergency medical response.
-   **Scalable Unit Economics**: Low marginal cost per new user/partner hospital.
-   **Clear Exit Path**: Highly attractive acquisition target for global health insurers (UnitedHealth), logistics giants (Uber/Grab Health), or regional telehealth leaders.

---

**Conclusion**
iVisit.ng represents a grounded, high-upside investment in the digitization of emergency medical infrastructure. By focusing on a "SaaS-first" logistics approach, the platform minimizes capital expenditure while maximizing market reach.
